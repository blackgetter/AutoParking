## AVM(Around View Monitor)
Using four cameras, we create an Around View Monitor (AVM) system that displays video on a combined image. The central point of this combined image is the turtle bot, and each camera provides a view of the front, left, right, and rear of the vehicle.

## LaneDetector
By employing Canny edge detection on the parking lot, we establish a Region of Interest (ROI) to inspect whether there are any objects within the parking area.
